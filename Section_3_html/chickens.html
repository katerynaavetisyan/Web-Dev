    <p><b>The chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junglefowl">junglefowl</a> species, with attributes of wild
        species such as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or
        cock is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been
        castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.
        Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.
        Traditionally they were also bred for cockfighting, which is still practiced in some places. The chicken
        domesticated for its meat are Broilers and for its eggs are Layers.</p>
    <p>Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as
        of 2018,[2] up from more than 19 billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any other bird.
        There are numerous cultural references to chickens â€“ in myth, folklore and religion, and in language and
        literature.[citation needed]

        Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origin theories of within South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East
        Asia,[3] but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian
        subcontinent. From ancient India, the chicken spread to the Eastern Mediterranean. They appear in Egypt in the
        mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from the land between Syria and
        Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.[4][5][6] They are known in Greece from the 5th
        century BC.[7][8]</p>
