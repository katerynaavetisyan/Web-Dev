            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine">Ukraine</a> (Ukrainian: Україна, romanized: Ukraïna,
            pronounced
            [ʊkrɐˈjinɐ] (listen)) is a country in Eastern Europe.
            It is the second-largest European country after Russia, which it borders to the east and northeast.[a][11]
            Ukraine covers approximately 600,000 square kilometres (230,000 sq mi).[b] Prior to the ongoing Russian
            invasion, it was the eighth-most populous country in Europe, with a population of around 41 million people.
            On 1
            January 2023, the United Nations estimated the Ukrainian population to be 34.1 million, with record low
            birth
            rates.[12] It is also bordered by Belarus to the north; by Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary to the west; and by
            Romania and Moldova[c] to the southwest; with a coastline along the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov to the
            south
            and southeast.[d] Kyiv is the nation's capital and largest city. Ukraine's state language is Ukrainian;
            Russian
            is also widely spoken, especially in the east and south.

            During the Middle Ages, Ukraine was the site of early Slavic expansion and the area later became a key
            centre of
            East Slavic culture under the state of Kievan Rus', which emerged in the 9th century. The state eventually
            disintegrated into rival regional powers and was ultimately destroyed by the Mongol invasions of the 13th
            century. The area was then contested, divided, and ruled by a variety of external powers for the next 600
            years,
            including the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Austrian Empire, the Ottoman Empire, and the Tsardom of
            Russia. The Cossack Hetmanate emerged in central Ukraine in the 17th century, but was partitioned between
            Russia
            and Poland, and ultimately absorbed by the Russian Empire. Ukrainian nationalism developed, and following
            the
            Russian Revolution in 1917, the short-lived Ukrainian People's Republic was formed. The Bolsheviks
            consolidated
            control over much of the former empire and established the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, which became
            a
            constituent republic of the Soviet Union when it was formed in 1922. In the early 1930s, millions of
            Ukrainians
            died in the Holodomor, a man-made famine. The German occupation during World War II in Ukraine was
            devastating,
            and seven million Ukrainian civilians were killed, including the majority of Ukrainian Jews.

            Ukraine gained independence in 1991 as the Soviet Union dissolved, and declared itself neutral.[13] A new
            constitution was adopted in 1996. A series of mass demonstrations, known as the Euromaidan, led to the
            establishment of a new government in 2014 after a revolution. Russia then unilaterally annexed Ukraine's
            Crimean
            Peninsula; and pro-Russian unrest culminated in a war in the Donbas between Russian-backed separatists and
            government forces in eastern Ukraine. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
            Since
            the outbreak of war with Russia, Ukraine has continued to seek closer ties with the European Union and
            NATO.[14]

            Ukraine is a unitary state with a semi-presidential system. It is a developing country, ranking 77th on the
            Human Development Index. Ukraine is the poorest country in Europe by nominal GDP per capita,[15] and
            corruption
            remains a significant issue.[16][17] However, due to its extensive fertile land, pre-war Ukraine was one of
            the
            largest grain exporters in the world.[18][19] It is a founding member of the United Nations, as well as a
            member
            of the Council of Europe, the World Trade Organization, and the OSCE. It is in the process of joining the
            European Union and has submitted an application for NATO membership.[20]

            Etymology and orthography
        </h2>
        <p>The name of Ukraine likely comes from the old Slavic term for "borderland",[21] as does the word krajina.

            In the English-speaking world during most of the 20th century, Ukraine (whether independent or not) was
            referred
            to as "the Ukraine".[22] This is because the word ukraina means "borderland"[23] so the definite article
            would
            be natural in the English language; this is similar to "Nederlanden", which means "low lands" and is
            rendered in
            English as "the Netherlands".[24] However, since Ukraine's declaration of independence in 1991, this usage
            has
            become politicised and is now rarer, and style guides advise against its use.[25][26] US ambassador William
            Taylor said that using "the Ukraine" implies disregard for Ukrainian sovereignty.[27] The official Ukrainian
            position is that "the Ukraine" is both grammatically and politically incorrect.[28]

        <h2>Early history</h2>
        <p>Settlement by modern humans in Ukraine and its vicinity dates back to 32,000 BC, with evidence of the
            Gravettian
            culture in the Crimean Mountains.[30][31] By 4,500 BC, the Neolithic Cucuteni–Trypillia culture was
            flourishing
            in wide areas of modern Ukraine, including Trypillia and the entire Dnieper-Dniester region. Ukraine is also
            considered to be the likely location of the first domestication of the horse.[32][33][34][35] The Kurgan
            hypothesis places the Volga-Dnieper region of Ukraine and southern Russia as the linguistic homeland of the
            Proto-Indo-Europeans.[36] Early Indo-European migrations from the Pontic steppes in the 3rd millennium BC
            spread
            Yamnaya Steppe pastoralist ancestry and Indo-European languages across large parts of Europe.[37] During the
            Iron Age, the land was inhabited by Iranian-speaking Cimmerians, Scythians, and Sarmatians.[38] Between 700
            BC
            and 200 BC it was part of the Scythian kingdom.[39]

            From the 6th century BC, Greek, Roman, and Byzantine colonies were established on the north-eastern shore of
            the
            Black Sea, such as at Tyras, Olbia, and Chersonesus. These thrived into the 6th century AD. The Goths stayed
            in
            the area, but came under the sway of the Huns from the 370s. In the 7th century, the territory that is now
            eastern Ukraine was the centre of Old Great Bulgaria. At the end of the century, the majority of Bulgar
            tribes
            migrated in different directions, and the Khazars took over much of the land.[40]

            In the 5th and 6th centuries, the early Slavic Antes people lived in Ukraine. Migrations from the
            territories of
            present-day Ukraine throughout the Balkans established many South Slavic nations. Northern migrations,
            reaching
            almost to Lake Ilmen, led to the emergence of the Ilmen Slavs, Krivichs, and Radimichs. Following an Avar
            raid
            in 602 and the collapse of the Antes Union, most of these peoples survived as separate tribes until the
            beginning of the second millennium.[41][need quotation to verify]
